# TicTacToe vs CPU

A command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can play against an AI opponent with multiple difficulty settings or against other players over a network.

## Back Story
This was my first "big" project when I was learning C++ and programming fundamentals. I decided to revisit it and enhance it with some new features. If you're curious about the original version, switch to the [TicTacToe2023 branch](https://github.com/Ty700/TicTacToeVsCPU/tree/TicTacToe2023) and prepare your eyes for that monstrosity. This was prior to my knowledge of git, so I straight up copied and pasted the code into GitHub, forgetting to add the .cpp extension for color formatting. Hence, the latest commit is only a few months old (at the time of this writing).

## Features
* Player vs. AI gameplay
* Three AI difficulty levels:
  * Easy: makes random moves
  * Medium: combines strategy with some randomness
  * Hard: implements the Minimax algorithm for optimal play (unbeatable)
* Network play (NEW!) - play against other players over the internet
* Colorized board with red 'X' and blue 'O'
* Configurable player names and symbols
* Option to select which player goes first

## Building the Game

## Dependencies

### Linux
* CMake 3.28 or later
* C++ compiler with C++17 or later support
* Python 3.6 or later
* OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later
* Protobuf (for network play)

```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libssl-dev

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler openssl-devel
```

### Windows
* Currently, the game doesn't build for Windows, but this is in-progress!

### Mac
* Currently, the game doesn't build for Mac, and I am not sure when Mac support will be available as I don't have a reliable way to test Mac OS!

### Compilation
You can build the game using the python build script: build.py

#### Production Version
```
python3 build.py
```

#### Debug Version
```
python3 build.py -d
```

You can also clean the binaries and CMake files via:
```
python3 build.py -c
```

## Gameplay

1. Configure the game through the setup menu:
   * Set your name
   * Select your symbol
   * Choose to play against an AI, local player, or over network
   * Decide who goes first

2. During the game
   * Enter a number 1-9 to select where to place your symbol
   * The board positions are numbered
```
	1 | 2 | 3
	--+---+--
	4 | 5 | 6
	--+---+--
	7 | 8 | 9
```

3. The game ends when either:
   * A player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal
   * All positions are filled, resulting in a tie

## Network Play (NEW!)

The game now supports network multiplayer using Valve's GameNetworkingSockets library!

### As a server:
```
./bin/release/TicTacToe --server
```

### As a client:
```
./bin/release/TicTacToe --client SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```

Replace `SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address of the server.

## File Structure

- tictactop.cpp: main program entry point

- Game.cpp/h: Handles the game logic and board state

- GameConfig.cpp/h: Manages game setup and configuration

- Player.cpp/h: Defines player attributes and behaviors

- AIMoves.cpp/h: Contains AI algorithms for different difficulty levels

- GameStats.cpp/h: Logic behind the tracking of game statistics 

- GameStatsDB.csv: The CSV file contains the following columns:

	- Game ID 

	- Player One Name 

	- Player Two Name
	
	- Winner Name 

	- Whether Winner is AI (T/F)

	- Winner Symbol (X/O)
 
## AI Implementation  

### Easy Mode
* Makes completely random moves with no strategy.

### Medium Mode
* Uses a prioritized strategy:
  1. Tries to win if possible
  2. Blocks the player if they're about to win
  3. Takes the center position if available
  4. Takes a corner position if available
  5. Makes a random move if none of the above applies

### Hard Mode

- Implements the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, resulting in an unbeatable gameplay. The AI with either win or force a draw.
  
## Game Statistics (NEW!!)

- The game now includes a comprehensive statistics tracking system that records the results of each game played. This feature allows players to review their game history and track performance over time.

### Features

1. Automatically tracks all game results

2. Records player names, and winner information

3. Maintains both a structured CSV database and human-readable game logs 

### Implementation Details 

- Game statistics are updated automatically at the end of each game. 

- The system handles file creation, reading, and writing operations with robous error handling.

- Data integrity is mainted through careful file state management

### Viewing Statistics 

- Players can view their game history by opening the GameStats.txt file, which provides detailed information about each game in an easy-to-read format.

## Future Improvements

- **Network Play**

- **Master Game Stats File**:
  - Create a comprehensive statistical dashboard that aggregates data from all played games
  - Generate visual representations of win rates and game patterns using graphical libraries
  - Track player progression over time with performance trends and improvement metrics
  - Implement filterable views to analyze statistics by different parameters (time period, player combinations, etc.)
  - Export statistics in multiple formats (CSV, PDF, PNG) for sharing or external analysis
  - Add session-based statistics to compare performance across different gaming sessions
  - Calculate and display advanced metrics like average moves per game, most common winning patterns, and position heat maps

	- **AI vs Human Win Rate**: Track and analyze the performance of AI players compared to human players to measure AI effectiveness and difficulty levels.

	- **X vs O Win Rate**: Determine if there's a statistical advantage to playing as X or O to balance game fairness.

	- **First Player Advantage Analysis**: Measure win rates based on turn order to quantify the first-move advantage and potentially implement handicap features.

- **GUI??**

- **Windows Build option**

## Learnings

### Data Structure Optimizations
- Implementing a bitmap to track player moves proved more efficient than individual character tracking. This insight came after having to convert all character representations to `std::string` to support the GameStats system, highlighting how initial design choices impact later extensibility.
- The bitmap approach enables cleaner game state representation: positions can be checked with simple bit operations, and display logic becomes more straightforward (e.g., "if position bit is 0, display X; otherwise display O").

### Coding Style Evolution
- Throughout this project (which expanded beyond its initial scope as I explored different aspects of C++), my coding style transitioned from K&R to Allman bracing style.
- While the adjustment still feels somewhat unnatural, adopting the Allman style aligns with my workplace standards, making this project a valuable opportunity to build new muscle memory for professional coding practices.
